<h2>Project settings</h2>
<p>
    1. First you need to clone all files and folders to your device.
</p>
<p>
    2. Check if <b> nodeJS </b> and <b> npm </b> are installed in the cmd terminal or another available in your editor.
</p>

```
node -v
npm --v
```

<p> If an error occurs at this stage, you can install nodeJS from the official site <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/"> <b> NodeJS </b> </a> </p>

<p>
3. If the versions were shown in the terminal, then the next step is to install all project dependencies.
</p>

```
npm install 
```

4. After some time has passed and the installation is complete, you need to start the server.


```
json-server --watch db.json
```

5. After the server is launched on http: // localhost: 3000 /, launch the project itself.

```
npm start
```
